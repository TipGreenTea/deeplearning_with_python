    "Your boss was extremely happy with your work and decided to entrust you with a task. They've seen a lot of people leave the company recently and they would like to understand why that's happening. They have collected historical data on employees and they would like you to build a model that is able to predict which employee will leave next. The would like a model that is better than random guessing. They also prefer false negatives than false positives, in this first phase. Fields in the dataset include:\n",

    "- Employee satisfaction level\n",
    "- Last evaluation\n",
    "- Number of projects\n",
    "- Average monthly hours\n",
    "- Time spent at the company\n",
    "- Whether they have had a work accident\n",
    "- Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years\n",
    "- Department\n",
    "- Salary\n",
    "- Whether the employee has left\n",

    "Your goal is to predict the binary outcome variable `left` using the rest of the data. Since the outcome is binary, this is a classification problem. Here are some things you may want to try out:\n",

    "1. load the dataset at HR_comma_sep.csv, inspect it with `.head()`, `.info()` and `.describe()`.\n",
    "- do the usual train/test split with a 20% test size or use a 5-Fold cross validation on all the data\n",
    "- what classification methods should we use?\n",
    "- check the confusion matrix, precision and recall\n",
